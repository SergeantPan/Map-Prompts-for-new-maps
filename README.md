# Map-Prompts-for-new-maps
For the purposes of allowing others to create Map Prompts extensions for custom maps not yet supported

The provided folder will have a fully ready-to-use Map Prompts .LUA file
Edit it using NotePad, WordPad or any text editor of your choice
There is an extensive amount of documentation inside, and the user only has to touch a small amount of it
If errors occur, please report them on the discussion tabs of the addon
If you have a map with custom locations marked out, but cannot get the addon to function
Please upload the file somewhere and I can personally look at the code and hopefully fix it
